## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools  
- Python 3.11
- Google Colab & VS Code  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.
- Version controlled via Git + GitHub
- Structure: modular

## üìà Why This Matters (Business View)
- **Data-driven decisions**: Harness ML models to drive revenue (e.g., predictive marketing) and cut waste (e.g., unnecessary ads)  
- **Scalable architecture**: Each practical is designed as reusable component ‚Äî can be pivoted into a micro-service 
- **Portfolio & credibility**: Demonstrates you‚Äôre not just code-deep, but business-aware ‚Äî appealing to stakeholders, investors, or enterprise-buyers
